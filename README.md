# rn-sqlite-api

The purpose of this repo is to demo the use of React Native to query an API and then load the data from that api into a local sqlite database that can work in the event that no network is available. 

* Consider forbidding the user from deleting the database rows when the network is unavailable.
* Need to review watermelonDB to allow the user to resync the database once the network is available.
